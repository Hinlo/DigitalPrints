# DigitalPrints
This simple notebook allows the conversion of photos - whether colour or monotone - into prints emulating lino-printing style. Using simple slider interfaces, the user can adjust the print detail, "ink" colour and choose whether to apply opening and erosion techniques. The script pulls from my drive path, these lines must be amended to the users own path.
